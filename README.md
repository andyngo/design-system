# Design System

This is a repository for the (early state) web design system for Hypered SPRL.

The current example content (located in the `docs/` directory) is raw HTML and
CSS (using Tachyons). It is visible at
[hypered.github.io/design-system](https://hypered.github.io/design-system/).

A component explorer based on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is visible
at
[storybook-static.andyngo1.now.sh](https://storybook-static.andyngo1.now.sh/).


## Notes

The `docs/` directory is used because this repository can then use the GitHub
Pages feature from the `master` branch.
