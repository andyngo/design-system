# Design System

This is a repository for the (early state) web design system for Hypered SPRL.

The current example content (located in the `docs/` directory) is raw HTML and
CSS (using Tachyons). It is visible at
[hypered.github.io/design-system](https://hypered.github.io/design-system/).

A component explorer based on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is visible
at
[storybook-static.andyngo1.now.sh](https://storybook-static.andyngo1.now.sh/).

A Next.js-based site to quickly experiment with the current design and new
components is visible at
[noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/).

Interesting pages are:

- [sprint-2](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/sprint-2)
- [blog](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/blog)
- [blog post](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/blog/starting-with-nixops-1)
- [not-os](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/projects/not-os)
- [waveguide](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/projects/waveguide)
- [nubs-bash](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/nubs-bash)
- [nubs-bash/hello](https://noteed-next.andyngo1.now.sh/nubs-bash/hello)


## Notes

There is also a custom Revealjs template that (should) match the design-system.

The `docs/` directory is used because this repository can then use the GitHub
Pages feature from the `master` branch.
