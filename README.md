# Design System

This is the start of a web design system for Hypered SPRL.

The current example content (located in the `docs/` directory) is raw HTML and
CSS (using Tachyons) before we use a more principled approach (e.g.
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)).

The `docs/` directory is used because this repository can then use the GitHub
Pages feature from the `master` branch.
